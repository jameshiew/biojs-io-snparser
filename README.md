# biojs-io-snparser

[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/biojs-io-snparser.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/biojs-io-snparser)

Parse raw SNP data into Javascript objects.

The ultimate aim of this component is to be able to parse the raw data from various direct-to-consumer (DTC) SNP
genotyping services into a standardised Javascript representation. The API is currently unstable and will likely
change.

Currently, raw data from the following services are supported:
* 23andMe

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install biojs-io-snparser`

In the `node` REPL:
```javascript
> snparser = require('biojs-io-snparser');
{ parse: [Function: parse] }
> rawData = fs.readFileSync('/home/xyz/raw_genotype_data.txt', 'UTF-8'); null;
null
> snps = snparser.parse({data: rawData, format: '23andMe-2015-07-22'}); null;
null
> snps.length
960614
> snps[42]
SNP {
  rsid: 'rs3737728',
  chromosome: '1',
  position: '1021415',
  alleles: [ 'G', 'G' ] }
```
